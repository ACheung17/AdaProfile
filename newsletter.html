      <h2>Newsletter Subscription Application</h2>
      <p class="projectP">
        This is a newsletter subscription application that collects and stores
        user's email, first and last name. Collected data is added to a mailing
        list, and is managed my MailChimp's services.
      </p>
      <p class="projectP">
        The front-end of the application is structured with HTML5 and styled
        with CSS3/Bootstrap, while the back-end is done with Node.js along with
        Express.js frameworks. To utilize MailChimp's services, the back-end is
        connected to MailChimp's API to request for its services.
      </p>
      <p class="projectP">
        The main page consists of three input fields to allow the user to
        provide their data; one "Sign Me Up" button to allow submittion of
        user's data; and a "Unsubscribe" button that allow subscribed members to
        unsubscribe.
      </p>
      <img
        class="projectImg"
        src="images/signupPage.jpg"
        alt="Newsletter Signup Page"
      />
      <p class="projectP">
        After users provide their data through the input fields, and click the
        "Sign Me Up" button. Feedback is provided to the user. A successful
        feedback would be like this:
      </p>
      <img
        class="img2"
        src="images/successFeedback.PNG"
        alt="Successfully subscribed"
      />
        <p class="projectP">
          While an unsuccessful feedback would look like this: 
        </p>
        <img
          class="img2"
          src="images/failToSub.PNG"
          alt="Fail to subscribe"
        />
        <p class="projectP">
            A "Try Again" button is provided for the user to have easy access back to the 
            main page for another try.
        </p>
        <p class="projectP">
            When the "Unsubscribe" button is clicks, the user is lead to a page 
            where they can provide the email that they would like to be unsubscribed from 
            the from the mailing list. 
        </p>
        <img class="projectImg" src="images/unsubPage.PNG"/>
        <p class="projectP">
            Similiar to subscribing, unsubscribing also provides feedback to the user:
        </p>
        <img class="img2" src="images/successUnsub.PNG" />
        <p class="projectP">In the case of an unsuccessful unsubscribing process, for example, 
            providing a non-existing or mispelt email, will result in the 
            following feedback message:</p>
        <img class="img2" src="images/failToUnsub.PNG" alt="Fail to unsubscribe">
